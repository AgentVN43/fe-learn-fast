# Fix: Components Not Rendering

## Issue
No components are rendering. routeTree.gen.ts was deleted to force regeneration.

## Solution

### Step 1: Start Dev Server (IMPORTANT!)
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Why?** TanStack Router plugin automatically regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` when dev server starts.

When you see:
```
VITE v7.3.1 ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
```

The routeTree has been generated ✅

### Step 2: Open App
```
http://localhost:5173 (or 5174 if 5173 is busy)
```

### Step 3: Test Routes
- ✅ Home page shows
- ✅ `/study-sets` shows StudySetList
- ✅ Click "Xem Chi Tiết" → `/study-sets/:id` shows StudySetDetail
- ✅ Click "Bắt Đầu Học" → FlashcardLearner shows

## File Structure (Now Correct)
```
routes/
  __root.tsx
  index.tsx
  study-sets.tsx                 ← /study-sets route
  study-sets.$studySetId.tsx    ← /study-sets/$studySetId route
  ...other routes
```

## NOT This (Old Wrong Way)
```
routes/
  study-sets.tsx
  study-sets/                    ❌ DELETE THIS FOLDER
    $studySetId.tsx              ❌ MOVE TO ROOT, RENAME
```

## routeTree.gen.ts
- ❌ Do NOT manually edit
- ❌ Do NOT commit to git
- ✅ Auto-generated by TanStack Router plugin
- ✅ Regenerates on dev server start
- ✅ Regenerates on vite build

## Troubleshooting

### Still No Components?
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Check terminal for build errors
3. Make sure dev server is running (not just build)
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### routeTree.gen.ts Not Created?
1. Kill dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete `node_modules/.vite` folder (cache)
3. Run `npm run dev` again

### Components Render but Routing Broken?
Check console logs:
```
=== StudySetDetailPage RENDER ===
✓ Params extracted: { studySetId: "..." }
```

If you see these logs, routing works!

## Build vs Dev

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Regenerates routeTree on start
# Hot reload works
# Fastest for testing
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
# Generates routeTree during build
# Creates dist/ folder
# Ready to deploy
```

## Summary
1. Run `npm run dev` (not build!)
2. Wait for "ready" message
3. Open http://localhost:5173
4. Test all routes
5. Check browser console for debug logs

Done! 🎉
